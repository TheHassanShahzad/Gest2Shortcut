    <h1>Gesture2Shortcut Tutorial</h1>
    <p>Gest2Short is a software which utilizes machine learning to recognize your gestures and carry out a given command that the user decides. The software can do all kinds of things from open any website URL or search term on any search engine, open every application and even carry out all possible key board shortcuts all with a simple gesture.</p>
    <p>The software is composed of 2 parts: the menu and the recognition software. In the menu, you can turn the software on or off, view/manage your gestures and even change the color themes from dark to white to even accessibility mode for those that are color blind. The menu also enables users to add new gestures, or delete them and even de-activate certain gestures if they are interfering with their work.</p>
    <p>The recognizer runs in the background of your computer and automatically starts up when the computer powers on. This part of the software is responsible for the detection of gestures and carrying them out.</p>
    <h2>Turning the software On/Off</h2>
    <p>Press the first button on the menu to toggle between on or off. This feeds back to recognizer so that it does not recognize any gestures when not intended to.</p>
    <h2>Adding a new gesture</h2>
    <p>To add a new gesture simply press the Shortcuts button and then press Add Shortcuts. This should present you with the following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open Website</li>
      <li>Open application</li>
      <li>Execute Keyboard shortcut</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first option will create a gesture which can open up a website or search something on a search engine, all of your choice. For example you may want to open youtube.com on the chrome search engine</p>
    <p>The second will open o any application such as word which you choose and the third will execute any paired keyboard shortcut such as alt tab or win d or ctrl c</p>
    <p>Select the one you wish and after entering the necessary information, press Add Gesture which will open up the camera and take 3 pictures of you.</p>
    <p>The first picture will be after 5 seconds, giving you enough time to come up with a gesture if you havenâ€™t already, The next 2 pictures will be after a consecutive 3 seconds and combined, these images will give the computer enough information on detecting your gesture. </p>
    <p>Then remember to press submit for the gesture to be saved. If you wish to view your shortcut then remember to close the menu application and re-open it.</p>
    <h2>Viewing/deleting/de-activating your Gestures</h2>
    <p>To view your gestures, go back onto the shortcuts page and press View/manage shortcuts. There you should see all your gestures with their function and buttons to delete a gesture or de-activate/activate it. </p>
